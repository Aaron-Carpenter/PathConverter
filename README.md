# Desktop Path Converter Tool w/GUI

## Overview

PathConverter is your go-to tool for converting traditional desktop paths to file explorer format.

## Description

PathConverter takes your traditional copied path, e.g., "C:\Users\JohnSmoke\OneDrive\Desktop\New Text Document.txt," and converts it into a more usable format for file explorers: C:/Users/JohnSmoke/OneDrive/Desktop/New Text Document.txt. This process involves removing parentheses and replacing backslashes with forward slashes, allowing you to use it in various hotkey-related applications. 

## Current Features

- Simple conversion of paths to file explorer format
- User-friendly GUI for easy conversion

## Future Features
- Expansion of functionality for use in other programs, allowing use of the path conversion method outside of our GUI
- History of path conversions able to be accessed outside of our GUI
